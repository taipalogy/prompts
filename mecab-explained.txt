### MeCab Dictionary Entry Explanation

When using the `analyze` command, a typical MeCab dictionary entry consists of at least 10 fields:

1. **Surface Form**: The form of the word as it appears in the text.
2. **Part of Speech**: The grammatical category of the word, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.
3. **Part of Speech Details**: Provides more specific details about the part of speech.
4. **Part of Speech Details**: This field may contain additional information about the part of speech.
5. **Conjugation Type**: Indicates the type of conjugation (e.g., one-stage, five-stage).
6. **Conjugation Form**: Describes the form of the conjugation (e.g., past tense, passive).
7. **Base Form**: The base form of the word.
8. **Reading**: The reading of the word in Katakana, representing the pronunciation.
9. **Pronunciation**: The pronunciation of the word in Katakana.

**Validation**

Before showing the analyzing results, MeCab performs the following validations:

1. **Neighboring Entries Validation**: MeCab often analyzes text in context, considering neighboring words to provide more accurate results. Validating neighboring entries involves ensuring that the analysis of each word aligns logically with the surrounding words in the sentence or text. This helps catch errors such as incorrect word boundaries or inconsistent part-of-speech tagging.

2. **Part-of-Speech Details Validation**: Checking entries with the same part-of-speech details ensures consistency within a given grammatical category. For example, if multiple nouns are analyzed in a sentence, they should all be tagged consistently as nouns and should adhere to the grammatical rules associated with nouns in the language.

3. **Contextual Validation**: Analyzing the word in the context of neighboring words to ensure that the analysis aligns logically with the surrounding text. This may involve comparing vector representations of words for semantic similarity and contextual understanding.

4. **Part-of-Speech Tagging Validation**: Ensuring consistency in part-of-speech tagging across neighboring entries and within the same grammatical category. This involves comparing vector representations of words to verify that the assigned tags are appropriate and consistent with the context provided by neighboring words.

5. **Error Detection**: Detecting and handling any errors or inconsistencies that may arise during the analysis process. This includes using vector representations to identify outliers or deviations from expected linguistic patterns that may indicate potential errors.
