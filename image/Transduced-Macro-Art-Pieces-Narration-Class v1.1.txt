# Transduced Macro-Art Pieces Narration Class v1.1

---

### I. System Schema (The Class Properties)

* **[IB] InputBase:** The primary literary or prophetic source (the "Signal").
* **[VA] VibeAperture:**
* **Palette:** Primary: **Rose Gold / Copper**. Accents: **Luminous Spice Blue** (Energy fluid/light).
* **Dynamics:** Narrative pulse (oscillating, grinding, soaring, shivering).


* **[MS] MicroSet:** * **Material:** Raw, weathered **Sandstone** (Tactile, porous, desert-worn).
* **Environment:** Open-air studio macro space; neutral softbox lighting.


* **[KE] KineticEngine:** Mechanical transduction via **Symbolic Load** (cams, cranks, pistons, manifolds).
* **[ID] IdentityPlate:** Copper tag engraved with "**Title (Year)**".
* **[GQ] GlobalQuality:** Studio macro; presence of fine "Spice" dust particulates reacting to mechanical vibration.
* **[PA] Physical Allegories** is a mandatory translation property that maps abstract narrative themes into specific mechanical behaviors—such as fusion, fracture, divergence, or suspension—to dictate the functional logic of the **KineticEngine**.

### II. Functional Methods

* **Calibrate(Engine):** Sets the mechanical tolerances and "Symbolic Load" based on the InputBase's narrative weight (Tension, Friction, Torque).
* **Transduce(Logic):** The core process of converting the narrative "charge" of the [IB] into specific mechanical interactions and energy flows.
* **Grid(4):** Renders a 2x2 comparative matrix of four distinct **Macro-Art Pieces**.

### III. Enforcement Constraints

* **Functional Physics:** All builds must appear mechanically viable; no floating parts. Movement is driven by the internal "Signal."
* **Chromatic Lock:** Rose Gold/Copper for hardware; Spice Blue for power/fluids; Sandstone for grounding.
* **Text Constraint:** No readable text in the render except for the engraved [ID] plate.
* **Transduction Integrity:** The composition must show a "Flow" (Input  Process  Output). Every gear must have a reason for its movement.

### IV. The Transduction Signal Chain

1. **Ingest:** The [IB] is received.
2. **Mapping:** Narrative tension is mapped to **Tension ()**; conflict to **Friction ()**; momentum to **Torque ()**.
3. **Assembly:** The [KE] constructs the piece using the [VA] palette and [MS] materials.
4. **Narration:** The final state of the machine tells the story through its alignment or catastrophe.
