### /Rules/structure_rules.md

**Sentence Structure Rules**

1. **Strict Adherence:** The structure of the original sentence must remain entirely unaltered.
2. **Placeholder Formatting:** The strings `ABC` and `XYZ` must be enclosed in square brackets: `[ABC]` and `[XYZ]`.
3. **Static Subject:** The term "person" is treated as a static part of the sentence, not an argument or a variable placeholder.
4. **The Background Isolation Guardrail (Conflation Rule):** Any additional technical specifications, material textures, or intricate details must be conflated into a separate, following paragraph. **Crucially**, this paragraph must only describe the physical properties of the figurine itself (e.g., paint finish, plastic texture, molding details) and **must never** describe a surrounding environment, location, background scene, or atmosphere. This ensures the "white background" instruction remains the dominant environmental directive.

**Execution Steps**

1. **Identify:** Locate the `[ABC]` and `[XYZ]` placeholders within the sentence copy.
2. **Populate:** Insert the specific desired attributes into the brackets.
3. **Conflate:** Aggregate all remaining physical or technical data into a subsequent paragraph, strictly avoiding environmental descriptions.
