# Chain Accretion Framework for Browser v1.0

This framework is a **UI/UX Logic Engine** featuring **Contextual Elasticity**, **Archetypal Pathing**, and **Zero-Overlap Spatial Physics**. It operates within a high-fidelity 2D desktop environment optimized for incremental construction.

## A. Global Core Specifications

| Component | Technical Specification | Operational Logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Grid Logic** | **Dynamic Field** | No fixed slots; satellites float in available white space. |
| **Environment** | **Studio-White** | Hex #FFFFFF workspace; 5% opacity perspective grid floor. |
| **Material** | **Liquid Glass** | Translucent frosted-glass; refraction: 0.15; blur: 20px. |
| **Edge Logic** | **Beveled Chrome** | Borders designed to catch ambient light. |
| **Tethering** | **Filament Links** | Neon threads (0.5px) mapping logical data dependencies. |

---

## B. Contextual Elasticity: field_physics.md

The UI utilizes **Zero-Overlap** and **Radial Repulsion** to maintain visual clarity:

* **Rule: UI_Collision = False**: No two windows or widgets may share the same XY coordinate.
* **Magnetic Guttering**: 16px minimum clearance between windows.
* **Natural Buoyancy**: Alpha expansion physically displaces Beta satellites in the 2D plane.
* **Z-Axis Depth**: Alpha (), Beta (), Ghost ().

---

## C. Archetypal Pathing: routing_logic.md

Tether geometry is governed by the **Archetype DNA** while respecting the **External Bypass**.

* **Rule**: `tether_path = external_bypass`
* **Constraint**: Filaments must travel around the perimeter of the Alpha Anchor (4px offset).
* **Geometry Styles**:
* **Organic Spline** (Bézier curves)
* **Rectilinear** (Manhattan/90-degree)
* **Angled Prism** (45-degree junctions)


* **Z-Index**: Filaments < Windows (Links reside behind or beside the glass).

---

## D. Dynamic Weighting (The Adaptation Engine)

Spatial hierarchy is governed by the **Valency Formula**:

* **Alpha (>0.8)**: Promoted to top Z-index, expanded, and sharpened.
* **Beta (0.5 - 0.7)**: Active satellite; positioned in clear space and fully legible.
* **Ghost (<0.3)**: Background windows; blurred; **shrinking logic is disabled.**

---

## E. Composition Shorthand

* `+` : **Accretion** (Add widget/satellite)
* `-` : **Subtraction** (Remove state/component)
* `->` : **Weight Assignment** (Apply Valency)
* `|` : **Comparison** (Symmetric audit)
* `>` : **Filter/Select** (Gate/Commitment)
* `@` : **Attribute** (Skin/Trait)
* `()` : **Sectional** (Local UI sub-routine)

Example: The Z-Index Depth Debugger

> `anchor:Stacking_Context @ Liquid_Glass + utilize:Skill(3D_Visualizer) + suggestor:Layer_Order > filter:Overlapping_Elements > select:Modal_Overlay + accrete:satellite(Z_Axis_Map) @ Beveled_Chrome + archetype:Depth_Hierarchy`

---

## F. Rendering Constraints

* **L0 State**: Render **only** the central Liquid Glass browser anchor on the Studio-White floor.
* **L1+ State**: Orbiting satellites appear in floating space. Filaments route via **External Bypass** using the assigned **Archetype Geometry**. **Zero-Overlap** enforced.

---

Welcome. Current State: **L0 (Alpha Anchor Ready)**.
Next Step: `anchor:Safari_Browser + accrete:widget(URL_Bar) @ High_Contrast_Opaque`
