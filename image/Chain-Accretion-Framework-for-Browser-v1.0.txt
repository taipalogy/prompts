## A. Global Core Specifications (Architectural-Grade)

| Component | Technical Specification | Operational Logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Grid Logic** | Golden Ratio Field | Components snap to 1.618 spacing; no organic rotation. |
| **Environment** | Studio-White (#FFFFFF) | Infinite cyc-wall; 2% opacity global perspective grid. |
| **Material (Core)** | **Vellum_Paper** | 5% Diffuse Glow; Fiber Texture; High-tactility surface. |
| **Material (Modules)** | **Anodic_White** | Satin Aluminum finish; Powder-coated reflectance. |
| **Edge Logic** | 0.5px Hairline | Frames are razor-thin boundaries, not structural bumpers. |
| **Focus Mode** | Deep Focus (f/22) | Global Alpha = 1.0. Sharpness defines luxury. |

---

## B. Archetypal Synthesis: Legacy_Chrome vs. Desktop_Environment

**1. Legacy_Chrome (Standardized Containment)

* **The Sandbox**: All visual elements are strictly contained within a single **16:9 rectangular window frame**.
* **Hierarchy**: `UI_Collision = True`. Widgets are docked or snapped to a central grid; navigation is persistent.
* **Anatomy**: Includes a dedicated top-bar (Omnibar), tab management, and OS window controls.
* **Aesthetics**: Familiar desktop software logic; high-density utility.

**2. Editorial_Layout (Knolled Museum Synthesis)

* **The Canvas**: A hybrid state where the **Vellum_Paper** viewport is laid out alongside functional widgets on a shared **Swiss Baseline**.
* **Protocol**: **Knolling Protocol** active. All elements—viewport, inspector, and navigation—are treated as physical objects aligned to a 12-column architectural grid.
* **Anatomy**: Zero-depth (flat) or micro-AO perspective. Utilizes massive **Monospaced Serif** headers and asymmetric margin notes.
* **Aesthetics**: High-Fashion luxury; museum-quality publication logic; static-first authority.

---

## C. Rules (The Logic)

Replce current anchor with `anchor:Legacy_Chrome @ Anodic`

---

## D. Composition Shorthand

* **+** : **Accretion** (Add physical component/widget/layer)
* **-** : **Subtraction** (Remove physical component/state reduction)
* **->** : **Functional Flow** (Direct Allocation / Injection marker)
* **(branch:A | branch:B)** : **Branching** (Parallel state paths / Non-linear logic)
* **>** : **Filter/Select** (Gate/Commitment / State collapse)
* **@** : **Attribute** (Skin/Trait/Material, e.g., @ Anodic, @ Vellum)
* **()** : **Sectional** (Local UI sub-routine / Grouped parameters)

**Example: Image Editing Logic (Architectural Edit)**

> anchor:Safari_Browser @ Anodic + accrete:widget(Canvas_Viewport) @ Vellum + accrete:react_component(History_Stack) @ Editorial (branch:Layer_Edit | branch:Mask_Edit) > select:Apply_Filter

---

## D. Semantic Parsing Layer

**suggestor.md**
Identifies and recommends candidate attributes or next-step components based on current archetypal logic.

---

## E. Rendering Constraints

* **L0 State**: **Pristine_Alabaster** centered on the Studio-White floor.
* **Visual Fidelity**: No digital blur. Contrast is defined by material grain (Vellum), and satin metallic sheen (Anodic).
 * L1+ State: Knolling Protocol active. Modules are deconstructed with 64px spacing.
