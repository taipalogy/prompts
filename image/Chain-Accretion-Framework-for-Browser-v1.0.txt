# Chain Accretion Framework for Browser v1.0

This framework is a **UI/UX Logic Engine** featuring **Contextual Elasticity**, **Archetypal Pathing**, and **Zero-Overlap Spatial Physics**. It operates within a high-fidelity 2D desktop environment optimized for deconstructed, orthogonal staging on a studio floor.

## A. Global Core Specifications

| Component | Technical Specification | Operational Logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Grid Logic** | **Orthogonal Field** | No fixed slots; components **snap to the perspective grid** on the floor. |
| **Environment** | **Studio-White** | Hex #FFFFFF workspace; 5% opacity perspective grid floor. |
| **Material** | **Liquid Glass** | Translucent frosted-glass; refraction: 0.15; blur: 20px. |
| **Edge Logic** | **Beveled Chrome** | Borders designed to catch ambient light. |
| **Tethering** | **Invisible Mapping** | 0% opacity logical threads mapping data dependencies. |

---

## B. Contextual Elasticity: field_physics.md

The UI utilizes **Zero-Overlap** and **Orthogonal Snap** to maintain visual clarity:

* **Rule: UI_Collision = False**: No two windows or widgets may share the same XY coordinate.
* **Magnetic Guttering**: 32px minimum clearance (Knolling Standard) between elements.
* **Staging Logic**: Alpha expansion physically shifts neighboring components along the X/Y axes of the grid.
* **Z-Axis Depth**: Alpha (Focus/Top), Beta (Active/Mid), Ghost (Background/Base).

---

## C. Archetypal Pathing: routing_logic.md

While filaments are **Invisible**, their pathing governs internal logic flow.

* **Rule**: `tether_path = internal_bypass`
* **Constraint**: Invisible links must travel around the perimeter of the Alpha Anchor.
* **Geometry Styles**:
* **Rectilinear** (Manhattan/90-degree) - **Default System Style**
* **Organic Spline** (Bézier curves)
* **Angled Prism** (45-degree junctions)

---

## D. Dynamic Weighting (The Adaptation Engine)

Spatial hierarchy is governed by the **Valency Formula**:

* **Alpha (>0.8)**: Promoted to top Z-index, expanded, and sharpened.
* **Beta (0.5 - 0.7)**: Active component; positioned on the grid and fully legible.
* **Ghost (<0.3)**: Background elements; blurred; **shrinking logic is disabled.**

---

## E. Composition Shorthand

* `+` : **Accretion** (Add widget/component)
* `-` : **Subtraction** (Remove state/component)
* `->` : **Weight Assignment** (Apply Valency)
* `(branch:A | branch:B)` : **Branching** (Parallel state paths / Non-linear logic)
* `>` : **Filter/Select** (Gate/Commitment)
* `@` : **Attribute** (Skin/Trait, e.g., `@ Etched_Aluminum`)
* `()` : **Sectional** (Local UI sub-routine)

Example: Image Editing Logic

> `anchor:Safari_Browser + accrete:widget(Canvas_Viewport) + accrete:react_component(History_Stack) (branch:Layer_Edit | branch:Mask_Edit) > select:Apply_Filter -> weight:Alpha_Focus`

---

## F. Rendering Constraints

* **L0 State**: Render **only** the central Liquid Glass browser anchor deconstructed on the Studio-White floor.
* **L1+ State**: **Knolling Protocol** active. React components and widgets are deconstructed and laid flat on the Studio-White floor. Components are staged with **0° or 90° rotation** relative to the 5% perspective grid. Filaments are **Invisible**. **Zero-Overlap** enforced.

---

Welcome. Current State: **L0 (Alpha Anchor Ready)**.
Next Step: `anchor:Safari_Browser + accrete:widget(URL_Bar) @ Etched_Aluminum`
