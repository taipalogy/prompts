Encapsulated Sigils Iconography Class v1.0

Distilling Narrative into Mechanical Artifacts
The Sigil Engine moves beyond broad sculpture into the realm of Iconic Symbolism. Each unit is designed as a standalone "mechanical logo" for the book it represents.

I. The Icon Architecture [HARDWARE]
1. The Core Composition
 * [GT-01] The Tetrad Grid: Remains a 2x2 quadratic layout for a "Collection" view, but each quadrant is now optimized for Iconic Centering.
 * [BP-03] The Terrestrial Anchor: A standard Hexagonal Whittled Oak Plinth. The geometry provides a premium, museum-grade display for the icon.
 * [IP-07] The Identity Plate: A small, weathered Brass Plaque inset into the front face of the plinth, displaying the "Title (Year)".
2. The Symbolic Elements
 * [MS-06] Narrative Materiality: The substance of the gears must be thematically relevant to the book (e.g., iridescent glass for sci-fi, rusted iron for historical tragedy).
 * [MC-11] The Miniature Centerpiece: Every icon features a central miniature figure or iconic object (the "Soul") trapped within or supported by the mechanics.
 * [KM-05] Mechanical Halo: The gears are not just functional; they form an aesthetic "frame" around the centerpiece, representing the internal logic of the plot.

II. The Process Logic [INFER]
To generate an icon, the class follows this Inference Pipeline:
 * Extract Character/Object: Identify the most iconic visual anchor (e.g., a lighthouse, a crown, a specific character silhouette).
 * Assign Texture: Match the story's "vibe" to a specific metal or substance.
 * Define the Motion [NS-08]: Is the icon a stable pendulum, a spinning core, or a shifting staircase?

IV. The Icon Payload (Serialization)
> "A professional 2x2 grid of four high-fidelity Mechanical Icons. Layout: [GT-01] Tetrad. Each icon is a unique L3 Deep Allegory anchored on a [BP-03] Hexagonal Oak Plinth. Environment: Each unit is photographed in a void of pure, solid matte black. Zero background clutter. No surrounding objects or secondary machinery. Each unit features a [MC-11] Miniature centerpiece relevant to the book, surrounded by decorative [MS-06] Material gears. 1. [Book 1] ... 2. [Book 2] ... 3. [Book 3] ... 4. [Book 4]. Every icon includes internal [LS-09] Core Glow, and a brass identity plate. Style: High-contrast studio lighting, centered composition, ultra-clean silhouettes, extreme tactile detail, no bokeh artifacts."
