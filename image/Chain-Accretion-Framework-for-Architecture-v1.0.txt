# Chain Accretion Framework for Architecture v1.0

This framework is a **Structural Logic Engine** designed for the incremental construction of complex systems and the isolation of variables through side-by-side auditing. It treats every addition as a state-change and every comparison as a **Delta Analysis**.

## A. Verbs & Nouns (The Components)

**Verbs: The Operations**

* **anchor.md**: Establishes the Level 0 state (e.g., `Iron_Hull_Seed + Beast_Walk`).
* **accrete.md**: **Additive Logic**. Adds a sequential layer or state. **Valency: 1–2**.
* **weather.md**: **Subtractive Logic**. Applies entropy and environmental erosion to a state, contrasting the growth of accretion.
* **filter.md**: Acts as a logical gate to reduce wide attribute sets based on specific constraints.
* **select.md**: Represents the final "collapse" of a filtered set into a committed, singular state.
* **merge.md**: Combines results from parallel branches into a single hybrid state.
* **compare.md**: Initiates a symmetric audit between two states. **Valency: 2**.

**Nouns: The Archetypes & Data**

* **archetype.md**: The "Logic DNA" (e.g., `Machiya`, `Botanical`, `Modular`).
* **material.md**: The surface data (e.g., `Weathered_Cedar`, `Wrought_Iron`).

---

## B. Rules (The Logic)

**valency_logic.md**
Determines structural "gravity" during `accrete` or `merge`:

* **Chaos (Shanty)**: Random offsets, tilt, requires `utilize(Scaffolding)`.
* **Grid (Modular)**: 0° tilt, vertical snap, requires `utilize(Gantry/Cranes)`.
* **Aspiration (Gothic)**: Pyramid scaling, vertical elongation.

**delta_audit.md**
Defines the **Comparative Blueprint**:

1. **Global Constant**: Shared `anchor`, `material`, and `environment` (The Control).
2. **Local Delta**: Isolates the variable (`Archetype`, `Level`, or `Weathering`).
3. **Labels**: Forces the AI to identify and separate the two states visually.

---

## C. Composition Shorthand

* `+` : **Accretion** (Add state)
* `~` : **Weathering** (Erode state)
* `|` : **Comparison** (Parallel audit)
* `>` : **Filter/Select** (Gate/Commitment)
* `@` : **Attribute** (Material/Trait)
* `()` : **Sectional** (Local sub-routine)

**Example: The Interstitial Bridge**

> `anchor:Beast_Walk + merge:Interstitial(accrete:L1..L3 @ (suggestor > filter:Brutalist_Capsule > select:Precast_Concrete), accrete:L1..L3 @ (suggestor > filter:High_Tech_Facade > select:Glass_Curtain)) + utilize:Scaffolding ~ weather:Industrial_Oxidation`

---

## D. Semantic Parsing Layer

**parser.md**
Converts symbolic chains into Lisp-style nested evaluations for execution.

**suggestor.md**
Identifies and recommends candidate attributes or next-step components based on current valency and archetypal logic.

**Example Input:** `anchor | (anchor + accrete:L1+L2)`
**Lisp Evaluation:**

```lisp
(compare 
  (accrete anchor) 
  (accrete anchor (L1 L2)))

```

---

## E. Templates

**comparative_study.md**

> **[GLOBAL]**: Common foundation elements.
> **[LEFT]**: State A (The control or base archetype).
> **[RIGHT]**: State B (The delta—added floors, archetype shifts, or merges).
> **[OUTPUT]**: Split-screen visualization with high-contrast technical profile.
