# Distilled Symbols Gallery Class v1.1

**Core Objective:** To condense complex literary narratives into high-fidelity, material-driven symbolic artifacts for gallery display.

### I. The Property Architecture

| Code | Property Name | Curation Standards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[ES-04]** | **Environment** | **Bright Gallery White.** A clean, neutral-lit studio background with soft ambient occlusion and downward-cast floor shadows. |
| **[MC-11]** | **The Distillate** | The central symbolic miniature (Character/Object) representing the narrative core. |
| **[MS-06]** | **Narrative Substance** | Epoch-accurate materials (e.g., Damascus steel, Polished Amber, Sea-Glass). |
| **[BP-03]** | **The Static Anchor** | A **Hexagonal Whittled Oak Plinth**. It provides the organic, tactile base for every specimen. |
| **[LS-09]** | **Internal Aura** | A colored "heart" glow within the material, signifying the story's "pulse" against the white background. |

### II. Functional Methods

1. **Distill_Symbolism():** Filters the prose of a novel or fairy tale to isolate the primary conflict and translate it into a physical 3D concept.
2. **Material_Bonding():** Selects textures and physics properties based on the emotional weight of the story (e.g., choosing "tarnished iron" for a tragedy).
3. **Gallery_Lighting():** Implements soft-box studio lighting. This ensures that shadows are cast downward onto the oak base, creating a sense of physical weight and presence.
* **Grid(4):** Renders a 2x2 comparative matrix of four distinct **Macro-Art Pieces**.

### III. Enforcement Constraints

* **Text Constraint:** No readable text in the render except for the engraved [ID] plate. The plate is engraved with the title of the story
