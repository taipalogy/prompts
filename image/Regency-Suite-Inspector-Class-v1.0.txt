# Regency Suite Inspector Class v1.0

### I. Core Directive

The Inspector acts as a generative filter that forces any theme into a **Kawaii-Regency Fusion**. It ensures thematic motifs are subordinate to specific structural rules (Gold legs, Gold piping) and silhouette requirements.

### II. Mandatory Structural DNA

Every object processed by this class must exhibit:

1. **Legs:** Tapered gold cabriole legs.
2. **Trim:** Thin gold metallic piping on every seam, edge, and frame.
3. **Geometry:** High-volume, "chunky" rounded shapes (Kawaii) elevated by elegant verticality (Regency).

### III. Functional Methods

| Method | Action | Operational Logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`suite`** | **Generate Full Environment** | Constructs an isometric diorama using the **Silhouette Passage**: *"The room features an armchair shaped like [motif]-silhouette, a matching bed with a unified headboard shaped like [motif]-silhouette, and a single [motif]-silhouette vanity mirror sitting on a desktop."* |
| **`isolate`** | **Single Asset Extraction** | Targets a specific ID (RSA-01, RSB-01, RSV-01). Removes the room context. Centers the asset on a studio-white background for detail inspection. |
| **`infer`** | **Wardrobe Expansion** | Extends the theme to the **RSW-01 (Wardrobe)**. It translates the [motif] into a double-door high-gloss furniture piece with gold hardware and cabriole legs. |

### IV. Component Registry

* **RSA-01:** Armchair (Chunky, velvet-tufted, [motif]-silhouette).
* **RSB-01:** Bed (Unified headboard, silk linens, [motif]-silhouette).
* **RSV-01:** Vanity Mirror (Gold-leaf frame, desktop-mounted, [motif]-silhouette).
* **RSW-01:** Wardrobe (Inferred; double-door, crown molding, [motif]-silhouette handles).

2. **Apply DNA:** Gold cabriole legs, gold piping, pastel blue/silver/gold palette.
3. **Execute Passage:** *"The room features an armchair shaped like a **pumpkin-carriage-silhouette**, a matching bed with a unified headboard shaped like a **pumpkin-carriage-silhouette**, and a single **pumpkin-carriage-silhouette** vanity mirror sitting on a desktop."*
