# Structural Logic & Parsing Manifest

The **SLP Manifest** serves as the authoritative registry for auditing, deconstructing, and synchronizing the **Chain Accretion** interface. This system facilitates high-fidelity **Structural Logic** validation through **Variable Depth Parsing**, providing a mathematically precise record of hierarchical nodes and material states.

### Core Syntax: The Nested Parser

The **SLP Manifest** utilizes a nested parent-child notation to catalog the relationship between the UI chassis, navigation nodes, and the viewport content.

**Standard SLP Expression:**
`@ [Chassis_Type] + accrete:[Parent_Node(Child_A, Child_B)] > select:Active_Node(State:Target) @ Material_Physics`

### Variable Depth Parsing: The Protocol Library

The SLP Manifest allows for seamless transitions between **Shallow Parsing** (for rapid layout overviews) and **Deep Parsing** (for technical component deconstruction). Utilize these specific triggers to calibrate the analytical depth of the manifest entry.

**I. Standard & Shallow Parsing (Layout Focus)**

> **"Parse the layout. Express the layout in shorthand chain expression."**

* **Primary Utility:** Standard operational baseline.
* **Logic Trigger:** `Base_Parse`.
* **Focus:** Records the current visible state and top-level hierarchy without initiating material physics or hidden node analysis.

**II. The "Architectural" Alternative (Hierarchy Focus)**

> **"Audit the UI hierarchy. Map the active state to a shorthand manifest."**

* **Primary Utility:** Deep-parsing the "plumbing."
* **Logic Trigger:** `@ shift:Editorial_Layout`.
* **Focus:** Prioritizes the **Chassis** and nested containers over artistic content. Verifies that all tabs and windows are correctly parented and aligned within the manifest.

**III. The "Deconstructive" Alternative (Component Focus)**

> **"Deconstruct the viewport. Log the current accretion chain."**

* **Primary Utility:** Deep-parsing materials and fragments.
* **Logic Trigger:** `explode:component_parts`.
* **Focus:** Triggers **Museum Synthesis** logic. It isolates technical textures (e.g., `Cotton_Knit`, `Vellum`) and logs every character fragment as an active, individual node in the manifest.

**IV. The "State-Sync" Alternative (Correction Focus)**

> **"Validate the active nodes. Output the current structural shorthand."**

* **Primary Utility:** Correcting visual "hallucinations" or state drift.
* **Logic Trigger:** `Blueprint Validation (Rule 5)`.
* **Focus:** Acts as a hard reset. Commands the manifest to ignore visual inconsistencies and strictly list the nodes that *should* exist according to the framework rules.

**V. The "Minimalist" Alternative (Speed Focus)**

> **"State check: Parse and chain."**

* **Primary Utility:** Ultra-shallow, high-speed telemetry.
* **Logic Trigger:** `utilize:filter.md`.
* **Focus:** Absolute speed. Provides a bare-bones logic log and current coordinates for rapid-fire iteration.
