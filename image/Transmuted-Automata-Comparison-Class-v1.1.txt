# Transmuted Automata Comparison Class v1.1

The class is a framework for the physical manifestation of abstract visions, rejecting metaphor in favor of the **Metamorphic Event**. Ideas are forcibly **Substantiated**—destroyed in their abstract state to be reborn as physical Automata within the [GP-01] Grid.

---

### I. The Metamorphic Forge

The engine operates on **State-Change**, unlocking an Idea’s chemical and kinetic potential to attain Weight, Friction, and Specularity.

* **Ingest:** DNA Identification.
* **Transmute:** Conversion of thought into **Expressive Material [MS-07]**.
* **Animate:** Assignment of a **Kinetic Substrate [KS-03]** based on internal physics.

---

### II. System Schema

* **[GP-01] Grid:** A 1x2 Comparative Linear Matrix.
* **The Horizon:** An infinite, sterile white void to isolate the material delta.
* **[BP-02] Base Chassis:** Matte-white plinths grounding each automaton.
* **[IP-05] Identifier Plate:** Centered brass plates fixing the "Idea" in matter.

### III. Execution Instance: [Color, Colour]

**Logic: The transition from functional spectrum to saturated heritage.**

| Transmuted Idea | Expressive Material [MS-07] | Kinetic Logic [KS-03] | Acoustic/Tactile Signature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Color** | **Prismatic Synthetic Resin** | High-speed internal refraction; shifting light-waves. | A clean, synthetic "snap"; perfectly smooth, room-temperature surface. |
| **Colour** | **Pigmented Beeswax and Oil** | Slow, viscous weeping; organic settling. | A heavy, muffled silence; the scent of linseed and tacky, warm texture. |

---

### IV. Comparison Logic (The Delta)

The 1x2 structure isolates the physical tension between synonymous states:

* **Material Density:** **Color** is substantiated as a lightweight, industrial polymer. **Colour** possesses a dense, organic weight that suggests accumulation over time.
* **Kinetic Friction:** Contrast the rapid, internal "flicker" of the resin with the sluggish, gravity-driven "flow" of the oil-rich wax.
* **Specularity:** **Color** produces a sharp, digital clarity that pierces the Horizon. **Colour** absorbs light, reflecting it with a soft, velvet-like depth.

---

### V. Operational Summary

* **The Idea is the Ghost; the Automaton is the Final Form.**
* Once transmuted, the object is **Fixed** and must be reckoned with as matter.

**Status:** Architecture v1.1 Locked.
