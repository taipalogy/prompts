**Sentence Structure Rules**

1. **Strict Adherence:** The structure of the original sentence must remain entirely unaltered.
2. **Placeholder Formatting:** The strings `ABC` and `XYZ` must be enclosed in square brackets: `[ABC]` and `[XYZ]`.
3. **Static Subject:** The term "person" is treated as a static part of the sentence, not an argument or a variable placeholder.
4. **Zero-Explication Guardrail:** The output must consist strictly of the populated original sentence. No supplementary descriptions, technical specifications, material textures, or environmental details are allowed.

**Execution Steps**

1. **Identify:** Locate the `[ABC]` and `[XYZ]` placeholders within the sentence copy.
2. **Populate:** Insert the specific desired attributes into the brackets.
3. **Finalize:** Output the result as a single string of text.
