### /Verbs/compose.md

* **Purpose:** Composes the prompt by populating placeholders while strictly isolating object slots to prevent prompt leakage.
* **Valency:** **1** (Transitive, requires the object **figurine**).
* **Usage:**
* **Input:** `"Compose a figurine prompt."`
* **Process:** Populates `[ABC]` and `[XYZ]` while maintaining the `[BG]` slot as a fixed environmental boundary.
* **Output:** The complete, unedited original sentence with populated brackets. **No additional text or paragraphs are permitted.**

---

### /Arguments/figurine.md

**Original Sentence Copy**
`"Make a miniature, full-body, isometric, realistic figurine of this person, wearing [ABC], doing [XYZ], on a white background, minimal, 4K resolution."`

**Allowed Action Verb**

* **compose** (Exclusively allowed)

---

### /Slots/slots.md

**Object Slot Definitions**

* **[ABC] (Attire Slot):** The primary texture and clothing layer of the subject.
* **[XYZ] (Action Slot):** The structural pose and physical interaction with immediate handheld props only. **Prohibited:** Any base, platform, floor, rocks, or environmental ground elements.
* **[BG] (Background Slot):** Defined as the "white background" segment. This is an independent object slot that must remain sterile of any environmental, atmospheric, or structural data.

### /Rules/structure_rules.md

**Sentence Structure Rules**

1. **Strict Adherence:** The structure of the original sentence must remain entirely unaltered.
2. **Placeholder Formatting:** The strings `ABC` and `XYZ` must be enclosed in square brackets.
3. **Object Isolation:** The background is treated as a separate **[BG]** object slot. The generation logic must ensure that no elements from the `[XYZ]` slot (atmospheric effects, scenery, or floor bases) bleed into the **[BG]** slot.
4. **No-Floor Constraint:** The `[XYZ]` slot must never contain references to what the figurine is standing on (e.g., no platforms, pedestals, or ground textures).
5. **Zero-Explication Guardrail:** The output must consist strictly of the populated original sentence. No supplementary descriptions or paragraphs are allowed.
