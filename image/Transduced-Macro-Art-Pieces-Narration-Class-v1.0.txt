# Transduced Macro-Art Pieces Narration Class v1.0

---

### I. System Schema (The Class Properties)

* **[IB] InputBase:** Primary literary source used to seed the thematic DNA.
* **[VA] VibeAperture:**
* **Palette:** Primary: **Rose Gold / Copper**. Accents: **Luminous Spice Blue**.
* **Dynamics:** Narrative pulse (oscillating, grinding, soaring, shivering).

* **[MS] MicroSet:** * **Material:** Raw, weathered **Sandstone** (Tactile, porous, desert-worn).
* **Enclosure:** **NONE** (Objects exist in open-air studio macro space).

* **[KE] KineticEngine:** Physical allegories via mechanical linkages (cams, cranks, pistons).
* **[ID] IdentityPlate:** Copper tag engraved with "**Title (Year)**".
* **[GQ] GlobalQuality:** Studio macro, neutral softbox, dust-particulate "Spice" haze.

---

### II. Functional Methods

* **Deconstruct(IB):** Isolation of structural narrative "gears."
* **Transmute(VA -> KE):** Conversion of vibe into physical motion logic.
* **Grid(4):** Renders four distinct instances in a 2x2 matrix.

---

### III. Enforcement Constraints

* **Semantic Purity:** No readable text in the render except for the [ID] plate.
* **Structural Integrity:** All builds must appear mechanically viable within the Rose Gold/Copper/Sandstone material physics.
* **Chromatic Lock:** Rose Gold/Copper for all structural hardware; Spice Blue for energy, fluids, or ocular glows.
* **Atmospheric Consistency:** Constant presence of fine "Spice" dust particulates in the lighting.
