### Designing a Taiwanese Language Keyboard Layout:

Design a layout for Taiwanese input, incorporating 9 tones, consonants, vowels, final consonant 'h' (for glottal stops), and punctuation (comma and period).

#### **Consonants**:
ㅂ, ㅊ, ㅉ, ㄱ, ㅎ, ㅈ, ㄲ, ㅋ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㄴ, ㆁ, ㅃ, ㅍ, ㅅ, ㄸ, ㅌ

#### **Vowels**:
ア, エ, イ, オ, ウ, ㄝ, ㄜ, ヰ, ヲ

#### **Key Considerations**:

1. **Tone Number Integration**: Place tone numbers (`1-9`) on the number row for easy access after syllable input.

2. **Consonant and Vowel Placement**:
   - Group frequently used sounds near the home row for efficiency (e.g., consonants on `ASDF`, vowels on `JKL;`).
   - Organize consonants to follow Taiwanese phonological patterns, ensuring ease of consonant-vowel combination.
   - Clearly distinguish aspirated and unaspirated consonants.

3. **Ergonomics**: 
   - Distribute keys across both hands, minimizing finger movement. Place common phonemes centrally.

4. **Phonological Structure**: 
   - The layout should reflect C-V-C syllables with logical placements for final consonants (like `p, t, k` and 'h' for glottal stops).

5. **Consistency and Familiarity**: 
   - Align with a standard QWERTY layout where possible to ease learning and improve intuitiveness.
   - Group similar sounds for faster learning.

6. **Special Character Input**: 
   - Use modifier keys (e.g., Shift) for less common consonants and features like nasalization and final consonants.

7. **Punctuation**: 
   - Comma (`,`) and period (`.`) for sentence structure.

### **Comment Section**:

- **Question**: Should there be a dedicated key for nasalization?
