# Designing a Taiwanese Language Keyboard Layout:

Design a layout for Taiwanese input, incorporating consonants, vowels, 9 tones,and punctuation (comma and period).

## **Consonants**:
ㅂ-b, ㅊ-c, ㅉ-ch, ㄱ-g, ㅎ-h, ㅈ-j, ㄲ-k, ㅋ-kh, ㄹ-l, ㅁ-m, ㄴ-n, ㆁ-ng, ㅃ-p, ㅍ-ph, ㅅ-s, ㄸ-t, ㅌ-th

## **Vowels**:
ア-a, エ-e, イ-i, オ-o, ウ-u, ヲ-ur, ㄜ-er, ヰ-ir, ㄝ-ea

## **Key Considerations**:

1. **Tone Number Integration**: Place tone numbers (`1-9`) on the number row for easy access after syllable input.

2. **Consonant and Vowel Placement**:
   - Group frequently used sounds near the home row for efficiency (e.g., consonants on `ASDF`, vowels on `JKL;`).
   - Organize consonants to follow Taiwanese phonological patterns, ensuring ease of consonant-vowel-consonant combination.
   - Clearly distinguish aspirated and unaspirated consonants.

3. **Ergonomics**: 
   - Distribute keys across both hands, minimizing finger movement. Place common phonemes centrally.

4. **Phonological Structure**: 
   - The layout should reflect C-V-C syllables with logical placements for final consonants (like `p, t, k` and 'h').

5. **Consistency and Familiarity**: 
   - Align with a standard QWERTY layout where possible to ease learning and improve intuitiveness.
   - Group similar sounds for faster learning.

6. **Special Character Input**: 
   - Use modifier keys (e.g., Shift) for features like nasalization and small version of a syllabogram.

7. **Punctuation**: 
   - Comma (`,`) and period (`.`) for sentence structure.

8. **Redundancy Spotting**:
   - Duplicate key check: Verified that each key is assigned only once in the base layout
   - Modifier consistency: Ensured that Shift modifiers don't conflict with existing key mappings
   - Character coverage: Confirmed that all required consonants, vowels, and punctuation marks are included
   - Unused keys: Identified and marked available keys for potential expansion or customization
   - Visual verification process: Created a comprehensive mapping table to spot any potential overlaps or gaps. Could be in table format in row-by-row order.

### **Comment Section**:

- Should there be a dedicated key for nasalization?
- What key combination could be used for terminal/proceeding tone?
