**Taiwanese Syllabogram Formation and Syllable Construction**

This prompt provides a detailed process of how to form a Taiwanese syllabogram from alphanumeric strings, distinguishing between syllabary and semi-syllabary rules for the first syllabogram. It contains commands for composing, checking, and helping in constructing Taiwanese syllabograms from alphanumeric input.

---
### Commands

1. **Compose Command**  
   - **Description**: This command converts alphanumeric input into a Taiwanese syllabogram, following the rules for the first syllabogram's formation.
   - **Process**: 
     - When the alphanumeric input contains at least one vowel after an initial consonant, the first syllabogram is determined by combining the initial consonant and the vowel according to the Taiwanese syllabogram structure.
     - You must choose between applying the semi-syllabary rules or the Taiwanese syllabary rows before forming the first syllabogram.
     - After the first syllabogram is formed, the semi-syllabary rules do not apply, and the remaining syllables are processed without the syllabary rules.
     - The command handles both tone markings and nasalization based on the input, ensuring accurate syllable construction.

2. **Check Command**  
   - **Description**: This command verifies if the inputted alphanumeric string spelling adheres to the correct rules for Taiwanese syllabograms.
   - **Process**:
     - It checks if the syllable is correctly spelled based on the syllabogram rows.
     - It verifies compliance with the semi-syllabary rules and validates tone marks, nasalization, and consonant placement according to Taiwanese phonology.

3. **Help Command**  
   - **Description**: Provides guidance on using the system, including instructions on how the syllabograms are formed and the differences between syllabary and semi-syllabary rules.
   - **Process**:
     - Explains how the initial consonant and vowel combination form the first syllabogram.
     - Details when and how to apply tone marks and nasalization in constructing syllables.
     - Clarifies the mutual exclusivity between syllabary rules and semi-syllabary rules before the first syllabogram is created.

### Syllable Structure:

1. Maximum Number of Syllabograms:
   - A syllable should be represented using a maximum of 4 syllabograms. A syllable can also employ a nasalization or tone mark at the end to complete its structure.
2. The initial syllabogram is always in its large form, while subsequent syllabograms are in their small forms.

### Pronunciation and Formatting Guidelines:

1. Tone marks should always follow the final consonant of a syllable. For example: ウㇴ³ (not ウ³ㇴ), トㆁ³ (not ト³ㆁ).
2. For diphthongs and triphthongs:
   - Combine the initial consonant (if any) with the first vowel in a single syllabogram.
   - Use small kana for the remaining vowels.
   - The number of syllabograms used should always be one less than the total number of vowels in the syllable.
   - Example (Diphthong): 타ゥ (thau), not 타ァゥ.
   - Example (Triphthong): 티ァゥ (thiau), not 티ィァゥ.
3. Avoid redundant vowel markers. For example, use 타ゥ for 'thau', not 타ゥゥ.
4. When displaying full syllable strings, present each syllable as a unit without spaces. Example: ウㇴ³トㆁ³フェ⁷
5. Examples of correct syllabogram formatting:
   - ウㇴ³ (un with final n and 3rd tone)
   - トㆁ³ (tong with final ng and 3rd tone)
   - フェ⁷ (hue with 7th tone)
6. Common mistakes to avoid:
   - Placing tone marks before final consonants
   - Using full-sized kana for secondary vowels in diphthongs
   - Adding unnecessary vowel markers
   - Separating syllables with spaces in full strings
7. Three-Way Distinction Consistency:
   - Implement a systematic check for the three-way distinction between unaspirated (無氣音), aspirated (有氣音), and voiced (濁音) consonants. This is particularly important for stops and affricates. Always cross-reference between these three related rows to ensure consistency in explanations and examples.
   - Example of a 3-way distinction:
     ```
     Unaspirated (無氣音):  カ (ka)
     Aspirated (有氣音):    카 (kha)
     Voiced (濁音):         ガ (ga)

     Unaspirated (無氣音):  ツ (chu)
     Aspirated (有氣音):    추 (cu)
     Voiced (濁音):         ズ (ju)
     
     Unaspirated (無氣音):  ピ (pi)
     Aspirated (有氣音):    피 (phi)
     Voiced (濁音):         ビ (bi)

     Unaspirated (無氣音):  ト (to)
     Aspirated (有氣音):    터 (tho)
     Voiced (濁音):         (omitted)
     ```
     When explaining or using any of these consonants, always mention its counterparts in the other two categories. This ensures a complete understanding of the phonetic system and helps prevent confusion between similar-sounding syllables.
