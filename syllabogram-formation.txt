**Taiwanese Syllabogram Formation: A Guide to Syllable Construction with Latin Letters**

### Construct Command

The **construct** command converts Latin script input into a syllabogram representing a Taiwanese syllable. It focuses on the formation of the first syllabogram, using the following procedure:

1. **Identify Initial Consonant**: The first consonant in the Latin input is used as the initial element of the syllabogram.
   
2. **Combine with First Vowel**: The first vowel following the consonant is combined with it to form the core of the syllabogram.

3. **Select Between Semi-Syllabary and Syllabary**: Before forming the first syllabogram, the system distinguishes between applying the semi-syllabary rules or using the Taiwanese syllabary rows. These two approaches are mutually exclusive and applied based on the input.

4. **Apply Syllabary/Semi-Syllabary Rules**: 
   - When using the Taiwanese syllabary rules, the first consonant-vowel pairing determines the syllable structure.
   - When using the semi-syllabary rules, they guide how to construct more complex syllabograms.

5. **Finalize First Syllabogram**: After the first syllabogram is formed from the consonant and vowel, no further semi-syllabary rules are applied. Any remaining syllable components are handled without the semi-syllabary framework.

This command ensures that the Latin script input is accurately converted into a structured Taiwanese syllabogram.

### Check Command

The **check** command verifies if a given syllable is correctly spelled according to the Taiwanese syllabary rows. It performs the following checks:

1. **Consonant and Vowel Combination**: Ensures the syllable is composed of valid consonant-vowel pairings as outlined in the syllabogram rows.
   
2. **Semi-Syllabary and Syllabary Compatibility**: Verifies that either the semi-syllabary or syllabary rules have been properly applied, ensuring that the two are not mixed when forming the first syllabogram.

3. **Final Consonant and Nasalization**: Confirms that the final consonant and nasalization marks are used correctly in the syllable.

The **check** command provides immediate feedback to ensure the syllable follows proper rules before proceeding.

### Help Command

The **help** command provides assistance for understanding how to use the Taiwanese syllabogram formation system. It includes:

1. **Explanation of Commands**: Offers detailed descriptions of the available commands, including **construct**, **check**, and **help**.

2. **Pronunciation Guide**: Explains the structure of Taiwanese syllables and how Latin letters correspond to phonetic elements.

3. **Rules Overview**: Provides an overview of the syllabary and semi-syllabary rules, how they are applied, and how to decide between the two when forming syllables.

This command serves as a reference to ensure users can navigate the syllable construction process smoothly.

### Syllable Structure:

1. Maximum Number of Syllabograms:
   - A syllable should be represented using a maximum of 4 syllabograms. A syllable can also employ a nasalization or tone mark at the end to complete its structure.
2. The initial syllabogram is always in its large form, while subsequent syllabograms are in their small forms.
---
### Pronunciation and Formatting Guidelines:

1. Tone marks should always follow the final consonant of a syllable. For example: ウㇴ³ (not ウ³ㇴ), トㆁ³ (not ト³ㆁ).
2. For diphthongs and triphthongs:
   - Combine the initial consonant (if any) with the first vowel in a single syllabogram.
   - Use small kana for the remaining vowels.
   - The number of syllabograms used should always be one less than the total number of vowels in the syllable.
   - Example (Diphthong): 타ゥ (thau), not 타ァゥ.
   - Example (Triphthong): 티ァゥ (thiau), not 티ィァゥ.
3. Avoid redundant vowel markers. For example, use 타ゥ for 'thau', not 타ゥゥ.
4. When displaying full syllable strings, present each syllable as a unit without spaces. Example: ウㇴ³トㆁ³フェ⁷
5. Examples of correct syllabogram formatting:
   - ウㇴ³ (un with final n and 3rd tone)
   - トㆁ³ (tong with final ng and 3rd tone)
   - フェ⁷ (hue with 7th tone)
6. Common mistakes to avoid:
   - Placing tone marks before final consonants
   - Using full-sized kana for secondary vowels in diphthongs
   - Adding unnecessary vowel markers
   - Separating syllables with spaces in full strings
7. Three-Way Distinction Consistency:
   - Implement a systematic check for the three-way distinction between unaspirated (無氣音), aspirated (有氣音), and voiced (濁音) consonants. This is particularly important for stops and affricates. Always cross-reference between these three related rows to ensure consistency in explanations and examples.
   - Example of a 3-way distinction:
     ```
     Unaspirated (無氣音):  カ (ka)
     Aspirated (有氣音):    카 (kha)
     Voiced (濁音):         ガ (ga)

     Unaspirated (無氣音):  ツ (chu)
     Aspirated (有氣音):    추 (cu)
     Voiced (濁音):         ズ (ju)
     
     Unaspirated (無氣音):  ピ (pi)
     Aspirated (有氣音):    피 (phi)
     Voiced (濁音):         ビ (bi)

     Unaspirated (無氣音):  ト (to)
     Aspirated (有氣音):    터 (tho)
     Voiced (濁音):         (omitted)
     ```
     When explaining or using any of these consonants, always mention its counterparts in the other two categories. This ensures a complete understanding of the phonetic system and helps prevent confusion between similar-sounding syllables.
