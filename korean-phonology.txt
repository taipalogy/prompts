# Understanding Korean Phonological Rules, Processes, and KIMMO Parsing

Show examples where the actual pronunciation has changed. List all Korean phonological rules including nasal assimilation, fortition, lenition, consonant assimilation, vowel assimilation, final consonant reduction, syllable structure, pitch accent, palatalization, devoicing, addition, dropping, combination of sounds, regressive and progressive assimilation, vowel harmony (모음조화), assimilation types such as complete, partial, absolute, direct, indirect, simple, double assimilation, and 사이시옷.

Based on this, examples from Korean where the base form (underlying mental representation), inflected form (grammatically altered form), surface form (actual pronunciation), and written form differ due to phonological rules or phenomena will be provided. The base form and underlying form are abstract representations of pronunciation before phonological rules apply, emphasizing their foundational role in linguistic analysis.

Special focus is given to examples involving lenition, 사이시옷, different types of assimilation, vowel harmony (모음조화), batchim (받침) consonants, compound noun formation, and other phonological processes.

### Examples with Different Forms

**Command: examples**

**Output:**

1. **Witton (English word example)**

   - **Base Form / Underlying Form**: Wit-ton (/ˈwɪt tɒn/)
   - **Inflected Form**: N/A (not applicable for English in this case)
   - **Surface Form**: Witton (/ˈwɪtən/)
   - **Actual Pronunciation**: /ˈwɪtən/ (surface pronunciation with vowel reduction and softened "t")
   - **Written Form**: Witton

   **Explanation**: In English, the word "Witton" exhibits a difference between its underlying form ("Wit-ton") and surface form. The underlying form separates the syllables, with a full vowel in the second syllable and a clear "t." In the surface form, vowel reduction (to a schwa in the second syllable) and a softened "t" create a more natural pronunciation. This is comparable to lenition and vowel reduction processes found in Korean phonology.

### Command: kimmo

Generates parsing results from the KIMMO parser for a given word, showing the underlying morphemes, inflectional changes, and the final surface form.

**Command: kimmo**

**Output:**

1. **chase+ed** (English)

   - **Lexical Form**: chase+ed
   - **Surface Form**: chas00ed → chased
   - **Parsing Explanation**: The KIMMO parser handles **chas00ed** by merging the two "e"s (from "chase" and "-ed"). The "00" in the surface form represents the two identical "e"s collapsing into one, which results in the written form "chased." Phonological rules, such as vowel merging and past tense pronunciation, account for the transformation from **chase+ed** to **chased.**
