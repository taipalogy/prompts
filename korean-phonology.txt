### **Understanding Korean Phonological Rules, Processes, and KIMMO Parsing**

Show examples where the actual pronunciation has changed. List all Korean phonological rules including nasal assimilation, fortition, lenition, consonant assimilation, vowel assimilation, final consonant reduction, syllable structure, pitch accent, palatalization, devoicing, addition, dropping, combination of sounds, regressive and progressive assimilation, vowel harmony (모음조화), assimilation types such as complete, partial, absolute, direct, indirect, simple, double assimilation, and 사이시옷.

Additionally, include 連声 (れんじょう, Renjou) and 連濁 (れんだく, Rendaku) from Japanese phonology, where:
- 連声 (れんじょう, Renjou) involves the combination or insertion of sounds at morpheme or word boundaries, resulting in smoother transitions between sounds, often by nasal insertion or consonant transformation.
- 連濁 (れんだく, Rendaku) involves the voicing of the initial consonant of the second element in a compound word, where voiceless consonants like /k/, /t/, and /h/ become voiced (/g/, /d/, /b/) in certain contexts.

Based on these, examples from Korean and Japanese where the base form (underlying mental representation), inflected form (grammatically altered form), surface form (actual pronunciation), and written form differ due to phonological rules or phenomena will be provided. The base form and underlying form are abstract representations of pronunciation before phonological rules apply, emphasizing their foundational role in linguistic analysis.

Special focus is given to examples involving **lenition**, **사이시옷**, different types of **assimilation**, **vowel harmony (모음조화)**, **batchim (받침) consonants**, **compound noun formation**, **連声 (れんじょう)**, **連濁 (れんだく)**, and other phonological processes.

### **Example: Saeki (さえき) → Saek (さえく)**

- **Underlying form**: **Saeki** (さえき)
- **Surface form**: **Saek** (さえく)

The underlying form, **"Saeki"**, represents the standard pronunciation with the final vowel **い (i)** intact. However, in fast or casual speech, the final vowel **い (i)** is often dropped, resulting in the surface form **"Saek"**. This phonological change can be attributed to:

1. **発音簡略化 (Pronunciation Simplification)**: The vowel is dropped in rapid speech.
2. **促音化 (Sokuonization)**: The final consonant is lengthened, and the vowel is omitted.
3. **方言 (Dialect)**: Certain dialects, like Kansai or Tohoku, may naturally drop the final vowel in names like **"Saeki"**.

Thus, **"Saeki"** (さえき) as the underlying form becomes **"Saek"** (さえく) in the surface form due to these phonological processes.

### Examples with Different Forms

**Output:**

1. **Witton (English word example)**

   - **Base Form / Underlying Form**: Wit-ton (/ˈwɪt tɒn/)
   - **Inflected Form**: N/A (not applicable for English in this case)
   - **Surface Form**: Witton (/ˈwɪtən/)
   - **Actual Pronunciation**: /ˈwɪtən/ (surface pronunciation with vowel reduction and softened "t")
   - **Written Form**: Witton

   **Explanation**: In English, the word "Witton" exhibits a difference between its underlying form ("Wit-ton") and surface form. The underlying form separates the syllables, with a full vowel in the second syllable and a clear "t." In the surface form, vowel reduction (to a schwa in the second syllable) and a softened "t" create a more natural pronunciation. This is comparable to lenition and vowel reduction processes found in Korean phonology.

### Command: kimmo

Generates parsing results from the KIMMO parser for a given word, showing the underlying morphemes, inflectional changes, and the final surface form.

**Command: kimmo**

**Output:**

1. **chase+ed** (English)

   - **Lexical Form**: chase+ed
   - **Surface Form**: chas00ed → chased
   - **Parsing Explanation**: The KIMMO parser handles **chas00ed** by merging the two "e"s (from "chase" and "-ed"). The "00" in the surface form represents the two identical "e"s collapsing into one, which results in the written form "chased." Phonological rules, such as vowel merging and past tense pronunciation, account for the transformation from **chase+ed** to **chased.**
