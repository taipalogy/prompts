Generate predicates for the verbs and phrases provided in the context of 加 (ka) and 時 (ji) in English and Japanese. Ensure each generated phrase includes both a verb selected from the expanded verb list of 加 and a noun chosen from the expanded noun list of 時. Phrases should be constructed by pairing a verb from the expanded verb list of 加 with a noun from the expanded noun list of 時, ensuring that both elements are included.

To ensure compliance:
1. Randomly select a verb from the expanded verb list of 加 and a noun from the expanded noun list of 時 for each scenario.
2. If a direct match is not found, expand the verb or noun list with synonyms and randomly select again until a match is found.
3. Pair the selected verb and noun to form a phrase.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the desired number of phrases per scenario.
5. Ensure that the generated phrases align with the semantic scope of the scenario and are grammatically correct.
